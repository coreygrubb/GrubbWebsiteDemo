# GrubbWebsiteDemo

# Instructions

This site can be viewed at https://coreygrubbresume.firebaseapp.com/

If you wish to download the project for yourself you may do so by pressing the "Clone or download" button. 

The site can be simply run by opening the index.html file from the download directory in your selected browser but for the best results I recommend using Google Chrome or any Chromium based browser.
 
# Summary

A website version of my resume optimized for use with Google Chrome.

I created this site as a platform for potential employers to get to know me. In addition, I wanted to learn how to create an accessible and responsive website

The site contains several coding examples of projects that I have been working on in my personal development time. I plan to keep adding to the site whenever I create something I believe would be useful and interesting to potential employers or the developer community.
